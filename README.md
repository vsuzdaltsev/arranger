# Arranger

## Infrastructure orchestration framework

### About

A toolkit designed for managing infrastructure described as an object model using Python. It is a Dockerized environment
that includes most of the necessary tools for development and testing. The PyInvoke library is used to create the CLI
interface. For creating/managing infrastructure, CDKTF and CDK8s are primarily used in conjunction with the SDK.
